# Starshade_Rendezvous_Probe_sims
Simulations for the Starshade Rendezvous Probe. 

Notebooks:
start github page.  include the following notebooks:
 - Completeness:
    - integration time for HZ planets (fig 4)
    - HZ completeness (table 5 / fig 9)
    - cumulative completeness (fig 14)
- yields by planet type (fig 15)

- photon counts (fig 5)
- RA/Dec and observability windows (fig 6,7)
- metallicity correlation (fig 10,11)
- (lowest priority; may be put off) targeting strategy (fig 13)
